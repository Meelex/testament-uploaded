# We can have permissionless crypto *and* responsible rails—here’s the minimum viable resilience

**Minimums for venues:**
- Segregated custody, no commingling  
- Monthly **proof-of-reserves + liabilities** (independent, attestations archived)  
- Circuit breakers on perp markets; conservative margin  
- 24h withdrawal SLA + on-chain audit trail  
- Public incident reports within 72h  

**Individuals:** zero leverage, self-custody what you keep, cash buffer, and clear “if/then” triggers (depeg >0.5%, ETF outflows, OI spikes). We don’t need bans—we need daylight and brakes.
