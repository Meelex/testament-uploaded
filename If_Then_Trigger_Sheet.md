# If–Then Trigger Sheet (fill in the blanks)

- **If** BTC drops _[X]% in [Y] hours_ **and** any stablecoin deviates >0.5%, **then** reduce risk by _[Z]%_.
- **If** exchange withdrawal queues stretch >_[N]_ hours, **then** pull to self-custody for anything you intend to keep.
- **If** perp funding flips extreme and open interest spikes, **then** halve leveraged exposure (or zero it).
- **If** two+ sirens fire (e.g., ETF net outflows + stablecoin discount), **then** go to “minimum risk” preset.

**Sirens to watch:**  
- Labeled sovereign/whale transfers to exchange rails  
- Stablecoin premium/discount vs. $1; reserve/attestation shifts  
- ETF creations/redemptions (sustained outflows = pressure)  
- Derivatives: open interest surges; funding rates; options skew  
- Miner stress: hashprice plunges; rising miner outflows
