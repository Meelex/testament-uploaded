Subject: Require daylight and brakes in crypto market plumbing

Dear [Rep/Senator/Agency],

Please prioritize rules that (1) mandate **proof-of-reserves and liabilities** for custodians/stablecoins, (2) enforce segregated custody, (3) require circuit breakers and conservative margin on derivatives venues, and (4) standardize 24h withdrawal SLAs with audit trails. These reduce contagion without banning innovation.

Sincerely,  
[Name], [City/State]
