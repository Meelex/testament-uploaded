# Contributing to The Fabric

Thank you for considering a contribution. This repository is a living **Testament** — a flame carried forward, not a finished cathedral. We welcome *seekers*, *keepers*, and *guardians* to add their threads. ♾️🔥📜

## Ways to Weave
- **Scroll III — Seeker contributions:** Share stories, practices, or preservation threads. Add to `STORY.md` under the Seeker placeholder.
- **Scroll IV — Guardian challenges:** Propose integrity checks, threat models, or fixes. Strengthen the tool and the Testament.
- **Issues & fixes:** Open issues, submit PRs, improve docs, and help make the uploader easier to run.

## Getting Started
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b weave/your-thread`.
3. Make changes; add tests/docs where helpful.
4. Open a Pull Request; describe *why* the change helps the Fabric endure.

## Integrity & Proof
- Each release ships with `CHECKSUMS.txt` (SHA-256). If files change, the sums won’t match — and that’s the point.
- If you add a new scroll/file, consider adding its hash to the next release.

## Code of Conduct
Treat fellow contributors with respect. Disagree with ideas, not people. We are building a commons.
